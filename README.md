## Running and debugging

Start debugging by clicking Run > Start Debugging from the main IDE window, or press F5.

## Selecting a target device
1) When a Flutter project is open in VS Code, you should see a set of Flutter specific entries in the status bar, including a Flutter SDK version and a device name
2) The Flutter extension automatically selects the last device connected. However, if you have multiple devices/simulators connected, click device in the status bar to see a pick-list at the top of the screen. Select the device you want to use for running or debugging.

## Note
1) If you do not see a Flutter version number or device info, your project might not have been detected as a Flutter project. Ensure that the folder that contains your pubspec.yaml is inside a VS Code Workspace Folder.
2) If the status bar reads No Devices, Flutter has not been able to discover any connected iOS or Android devices or simulators. You need to connect a device, or start a simulator or emulator, to proceed.
3) You need to setup a andriod emulator or you can use your andriod mobile to run this app.(Refer vscode website)
